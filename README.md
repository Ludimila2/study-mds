<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>Study Markdowns is my personal repository to take notes of programming languages or technologies. Each topic is included into a branch with his name.</p>

Example: If you want to search <em>CSS Grid</em> notes

`branch: css`

`file: css-grid.md`

<h4>I hope these notes can help you in some way</h4>

<p>So... <strong>enjoy!</strong></p>
